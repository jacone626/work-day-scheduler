This quiz has a straightforward design with very few graphics other than the timer and quiz questions. When you open the website, you are shown the page below. There is a header that displays a link to highscores in the left corner and a timer in the right corner. Below that is a description of the quiz parameters and a button to start the quiz.

Once you click on the "Start Quiz" button, the timer will start and you will be shown the first question of the quiz. Simply click on the item that you believe is correct and the quiz will move to the next question. Once you click on an answer, a "Correct" or "Wrong" statement will be shown below the quiz questions. As stated in the previous section, wrong answers will be penalized by 15 seconds. The quiz will end either after you finish the 5 questions or if you run out of time before finishing the 5 questions.

When the quiz is complete, you are shown the page pictured below. Your final score is equal to however much time was left on the timer when you completed the quiz. You then have the option to enter your initials and click submit to save your high score.

Once you enter your initials, you are taken to a page that displays highscores. Your highscore should be logged with your initials and the score next to them. If you want to re-take the quiz, you can click on the "Go back" button to refresh the page. If you would like to clear your highscores, then you can click on the "Clear Highscores" button. This page is pictured below.
